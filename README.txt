This was an assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course. The objective of the
assignment was to implement and analyze different types of machine learning algorithms,
namely KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. The 
plot method was already implemented for me. 

Through this assignment, I learned how to use sklearn.
